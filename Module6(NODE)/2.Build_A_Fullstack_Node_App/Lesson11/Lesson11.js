// serve the frontend

// Here we will just use what we have learned in the previous lessons to serve the frontend files (HTML, CSS, JS) from our Node.js server. We will use the 'fs' module to read the files from the file system and send them as responses to HTTP requests.

// There are some challenges in the lesson that are solved

// We learn about Enoent error handling and how to handle it in our code, we also learn about the importance of setting the correct content type for the response based on the file type being served. We also learn about the different approaches to get __dirname and __filename in ES Modules and CommonJS.
