The parseJSONBody() function will do the following:
    1. It will listen to the 'data' event on the request object to collect the incoming data chunks and concatenate them into a single string called 'body'.

and other general info given as challenges in the files i.e. parseJSONBody.js and routeHandlers.js

The server code remains the same right now.
