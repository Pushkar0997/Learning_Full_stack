// Routings and paths

/*
In this scrim a separate website for retrotech is created and I will create a separate
folder called retrotech and put all the files there and keep this as documentation and notes
for the course as we continue. This retrotech website is a simple webstore for retro tech
products.

The thing to start with is how can I serve my store.
