// Outro

/*
What we studied:
- The fs module for file handling
- The http module for creating a server
- The path module for handling file paths
- The events module for creating and handling custom events
- The sanitize-html library for sanitizing user input


Strech Goals:
1. Error handling:
- a client requests /api/xyz (This exists for api but not for /api/xyz)
- a client requests to /api but send methodds other than GET or POST

2. Add uuids(universally unique identifiers) to each sighting. This will help us identify each sighting and make it easier to update or delete them in the future.
- Use a dependency called uuid to generate unique ids for each sighting.
