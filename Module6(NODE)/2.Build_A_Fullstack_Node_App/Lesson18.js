All the initail work for handling POST requests was done in the previous lesson. In this lesson, we will implement the addNewSighting() function that we imported in our routeHandlers.js file. This function will be responsible for adding a new sighting to our data.json file.

The addNewSighting() function will take in the new sighting data as an argument, read the existing data from the json file, add the new sighting to the existing data, and then write the updated data back to the json file.

The code for the addNewSighting() function is as follows:
