// Welcome to Node

/*
Back in the day , Web Development was a fragmented process. Front end code run in browser
with Javascript while backend logic was written in languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, Java,
C#, etc. This meant that developers had to learn multiple languages and tools to build a 
complete web application.
In 2009, Ryan Dahl created Node.js, a runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side. This was a game-changer for web development, as it enabled developers to use a single language (JavaScript) for both front-end and back-end development. Node.js is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which makes it fast and efficient for handling server-side tasks.
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it ideal for building scalable and high-performance
