// Welcome to Node

/*
Back in the day , Web Development was a fragmented process. Front end code run in browser
with Javascript while backend logic was written in languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, Java,
C#, etc. This meant that developers had to learn multiple languages and tools to build a 
complete web application.
In 2009, Ryan Dahl created Node.js, a runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side. This was a game-changer for web development, as it enabled developers to use a single language (JavaScript) for both front-end and back-end development. Node.js is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which makes it fast and efficient for handling server-side tasks.
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it ideal for building scalable and high-performance

Node js is a versatile platform that can be used for a wide range of applications, including web servers, real-time applications, APIs, and more. It has a large and active community, which means there are plenty of resources and libraries available for developers to use. With Node.js, developers can build fast, efficient, and scalable applications using JavaScript on the server side.
And thanks to npm it also give you access to millions of open source tools that helps you build faster., smarter and more efficiently.

Where you will Find Node js:
- Server-rendered Apps
- Microservices
- Backend Services for Mobile Apps
- Bots and scrappers
- Desktop Apps
- Automation Tools
- Internet of Things (IoT) Devices

Our Projects:
- Wild Horizon API
- Spooky App with encounter with paranormal

Javascript works in the browser because browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine that can execute JavaScript code. When you load a web page, the browser downloads the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files associated with that page. The JavaScript engine then parses and executes the JavaScript code, allowing it to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), handle user interactions, and perform various tasks on the client side.
e.g. Chrome uses the V8 JavaScript engine, Firefox uses SpiderMonkey, and Safari uses JavaScriptCore. These engines are responsible for interpreting and executing JavaScript code in the browser, enabling developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications.
The V8 engine is also used in Node.js, which allows JavaScript to be executed on the server side. This means that developers can use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side development, making it a versatile language for web development.
Node js is not a language, it is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. It provides a set of libraries and tools that enable developers to build server-side applications using JavaScript. Node.js is built on top of the V8 JavaScript engine, which is the same engine used by Google Chrome to execute JavaScript in the browser. This means that developers can use their existing knowledge of JavaScript to build server-side applications with Node.js, making it a popular choice for web development.

Course Requirements:
1. Basic understanding of JavaScript
    - map, reduce, filter
    - async programming (callbacks, promises, async/await)
2. No framework knowledge required
3. No knowledge of Node.js or any other backend technology is required

Why its good to learn Node.js:
1. JavaScript Everywhere: With Node.js, you can use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side development, which allows for a more seamless development experience and reduces the need to learn multiple languages.
2. Large Ecosystem: Node.js has a vast ecosystem of libraries and tools available through npm (Node Package Manager), which makes it easier to find solutions to common problems and accelerate development.
3. Performance: Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which is known for its speed and efficiency. This makes Node.js a great choice for building high-performance applications.
4. Scalability: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which allows it to handle a large number of concurrent connections with ease. This makes it ideal for building scalable applications.
5. Community Support: Node.js has a large and active community of developers who contribute to the platform and provide support through forums, tutorials, and open-source projects.

- Get to really understand Node.js
    - Makes learning other frameworks and libraries easier
- Framework independence
    - NestJS, Express, Fastify, Koa, etc. are all built on top of Node.js
- Node.js is used in production apps without frameworks(Not common but it is possible)
