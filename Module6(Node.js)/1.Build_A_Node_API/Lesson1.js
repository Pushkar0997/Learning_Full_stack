// Wild Horizon API

/*
We will build a REST API , The wild Horizon API
It will give people some really wild places to visit in the world, and some really wild things to do there.

3 ways user can get the data:
- /api
- /api/country/india
-/ api?continent=asia&is_open_to_public=true

We have a whole ton of data in data.js file, we will use that data to build our API. We will start by building a simple API that returns all the data, and then we will add more functionality to it.

We will be studying:
1. The core http module in Node.js
- creating a server
- sending status codes(200, 404, 500, etc.)
- setting headers
- handling requests and responses
- filtering data
- extracting query parameters
and many more things that are essential to building a Node.js API.+ Challenges
