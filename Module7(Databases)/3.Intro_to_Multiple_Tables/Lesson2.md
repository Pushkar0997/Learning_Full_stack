# Setup

This lesson tells about the general setup of the file system for the project. It also gives an introduction to the tools we will be using in this module.

Nothing special, just 4 tables, 
1. for the cars
2. for the new dealership
3. for the staff
4. for sold cars.

Need to learn how to create tables, how to link them together, and how to query them together. Inside js file system.
