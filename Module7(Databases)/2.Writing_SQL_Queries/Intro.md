The code starts with talking about the project that will be used in order to better understand SQL and databases. It is a project about a database of Retro Cars of 1900s. 
Then the next lesson talks about the project setup of database in node environment. All the things are setup in a index.js file. Use of PostgreSQL is made in order to create the database and tables. The PGLite library is used to make the database within index.js and a separate SQL file is used to write the SQL queries. The SQL file is then imported into index.js and the queries are executed in order to create the tables and insert the data into the tables.
