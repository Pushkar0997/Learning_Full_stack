The code starts with talking about the project that will be used in order to better understand SQL and databases. It is a project about a database of Retro Cars of 1900s. 
Then the next lesson talks about the project setup of database in node environment. All the things are setup in a index.js file. Use of PostgreSQL is made in order to create the database and tables. The PGLite library is used to make the database within index.js and a separate SQL file is used to write the SQL queries. The SQL file is then imported into index.js and the queries are executed in order to create the tables and insert the data into the tables.
Most of the contents of this module are very basic things like select and moves to some more fundamentals things later. I already know most part of this section but I will go through all the contents in order to refresh my memory and also to see if there is anything new that I can learn from this section. But making notes is not sure, I will just go through the contents and try to understand them. If there is anything new that I learn, then I will make notes of that. Otherwise, I will just go through the contents and try to understand them. And most likely the notes will be in notebook and will come here only if necessary.
